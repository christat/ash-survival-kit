# Ash Survival Kit
My own attempt at [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) using Rust with [Ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash).

## Status

This is very much a work in progress effort. I'll try to keep the commits to package the changes required for every chapter (which ironically this README commit breaks).

Currently the code is oriented towards **Windows/WSL** (I know :sweat_smile:) but one of the eventual goals is to port all platform-specific code to Linux, and perhaps OSX as a stretch goal.
